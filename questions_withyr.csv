We write: \(\frac{1}{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx+C}{x^2+x+1}\). Setting \(x=1\) gives \(1 = A(1+1+1)=3A\) so that \(A=\frac{1}{3}\). Solving for \(B\) and \(C\) by equating coefficients yields \(B=-\frac{1}{3}\) and \(C=-\frac{2}{3}\). Thus, the decomposition becomes \(\frac{1}{3}\Big(\frac{1}{x-1} - \frac{x+2}{x^2+x+1}\Big)\), which is option A."
Algebra,3,"The first term of a geometric progression is twice its common ratio.

The sum of the first two terms is \(a+ar=1.6(1+0.8)=1.6(1.8)=2.88\), and \(2.88\) equals \(\frac{72}{25}\). Thus, the correct answer is option C."
Financial Arithmetic,2,"A trader bought 100 oranges at 5 for N1.20, 20 oranges got spoilt and the remaining were sold at 4 for N1.50. Find the percentage gain or loss. \(\quad (\text{Jamb 1999}). \)","\(30\%\) gain","\(25\%\) gain","\(30\%\) loss","\(25\%\) loss",B,"First, we calculate the cost price (CP) of the oranges. The trader bought 100 oranges at a rate of 5 for N1.20, so the number of groups is \(\frac{100}{5}=20\). Thus, \(\text{CP}=20 \times 1.20=N24\). Next, since 20 oranges spoiled, 80 oranges were sold at 4 for N1.50, so the number of groups is \(\frac{80}{4}=20\) and the selling price (SP) is \(\text{SP}=20 \times 1.50=N30\). The profit is \(\text{Profit}=30-24=N6\). Finally, the percentage gain is calculated as \(\frac{6}{24}\times 100\%\ =25\%\). Therefore, the correct answer is option B."

Binary Operations,2,"A binary operation \(*\) is defined by \(a*b = ab + a + b\) for any real numbers \(a\) and \(b\).

The identity element is the number that, when used in the operation with any number, gives back that number. In this case, 0 is the identity. To find the inverse of 2 (call it \(x\)), we need \(2*x = 0\). That means \(2x + 2 + x = 3x + 2 = 0\). Solving for \(x\), we subtract 2 from both sides and then divide by 3: \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\)."
Algebra,1,"Factorize completely \(x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2} + 3x + 3y - 18\) \(\quad (\text{Jamb 1999}). \)","\((x+y+6)(x+y-3)\)","\((x-y-6)(x-y+3)\)","\((x-y+6)(x-y-3)\)","\((x+y-6)(x+y+3)\)",A,"Notice that \(x^{2} + 2xy + y^{2}\) can be rewritten as \((x+y)^2\).

Replacing \(u\) with \(x+y\) gives \((x+y+6)(x+y-3)\)."
Sets,2,"A group of market women sell at least one of yam, plantain and maize. 12 sell maize, 10 sell yam and 14 sell plantain; 5 sell plantain and maize, 4 sell yam and maize, 2 sell yam and plantain only while 3 sell all three.

Then subtract those counted twice: \(5+4+(2+3)=14\) (note: the 2 who sell yam and plantain only plus the 3 who sell all three make 5 for that pair). Finally, add back the 3 counted three times. Thus, \(36-14+3=25\). Therefore, the correct answer is option A."

Since \(10=2\times5\), using log properties: \(\log_8 10 = \log_8 2+\log_8 5\). Because \(8=2^3\), we have \(\log_8 2=\frac{1}{3}\). Therefore, \(X=\frac{1}{3}+\log_8 5\), so \(\log_8 5=X-\frac{1}{3}\). Hence, the correct answer is option C."
Algebra,3,"Find the value of \( X \) if \(\displaystyle \frac{\sqrt{2}}{x+\sqrt{2}} = \frac{1}{x-\sqrt{2}}\). \(\quad (\text{Jamb 1999}). \)",\(3\sqrt{2}+4\),\(3\sqrt{2}-4\),\(3-2\sqrt{2}\),\(4+2\sqrt{2}\),B,"Cross-multiply to eliminate fractions: \(\sqrt{2}(x-\sqrt{2})=x+\sqrt{2}\). Expanding gives \(x\sqrt{2}-2=x+\sqrt{2}\). Rearranging, \(x\sqrt{2}-x=2+\sqrt{2}\), or \(x(\sqrt{2}-1)=2+\sqrt{2}\). Solve for \(x\): \(x=\frac{2+\sqrt{2}}{\sqrt{2}-1}\). Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{2}+1\): \(x=\frac{(2+\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2}+1)}{(\sqrt{2})^2-1^2}=\frac{(2+\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2}+1)}{2-1}=(2+\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2}+1)\).

The numerator becomes \(a^{\frac{3}{2}}b^{-\frac{9}{4}}c^{\frac{3}{4}}\). When dividing by \(a^{-1}b^{4}c^{5}\), subtract the exponents: For \(a\): \(\frac{3}{2}-(-1)=\frac{5}{2}\); for \(b\): \(-\frac{9}{4}-4=-\frac{25}{4}\); for \(c\): \(\frac{3}{4}-5=-\frac{17}{4}\). Thus, \(p=\frac{5}{2}\) and \(q=-\frac{25}{4}\). Now, \(p+2q=\frac{5}{2}+2\left(-\frac{25}{4}\right)=\frac{5}{2}-\frac{50}{4}=\frac{5}{2}-\frac{25}{2}=-\frac{20}{2}=-10\).

Their difference is given as \(P\). The problem says that when you add these two numbers, the result is two times their difference. This means if we call the smaller number \(b\) and the larger \(a\), then \(a + b = 2(a-b)\). When you solve this, you find that \(a = 3b\). Since the difference \(a - b\) equals \(P\), then \(b = \frac{P}{2}\) and so \(a = \frac{3P}{2}\). Therefore, the larger number is \( \frac{3P}{2}\)."

The cost for oranges is \(5X\) and for mangoes it is \(4 \times 2X = 8X\). Together, the total cost is \(5X+8X = 13X\). Since the total spending is between N65 and N130, we write \(65 \leq 13X \leq 130\). Dividing all parts by 13 gives \(5 \leq X \leq 10\)."
