We write: \(\frac{1}{(x-1)(x^2+x+1)} = \frac{A}{x-1} + \frac{Bx+C}{x^2+x+1}\). Setting \(x=1\) gives \(1 = A(1+1+1)=3A\) so that \(A=\frac{1}{3}\). Solving for \(B\) and \(C\) by equating coefficients yields \(B=-\frac{1}{3}\) and \(C=-\frac{2}{3}\).

Algebra,3,The first term of a geometric progression is twice its common ratio.

The sum of the first two terms is \(a+ar=1.6(1+0.8)=1.6(1.8)=2.88\), and \(2.88\) equals \(\frac{72}{25}\). Thus, the correct answer is option C.",Jamb 1999
Financial Arithmetic,2,"A trader bought 100 oranges at 5 for N1.20, 20 oranges got spoilt and the remaining were sold at 4 for N1.50. Find the percentage gain or loss. ",\(30\%\) gain,\(25\%\) gain,\(30\%\) loss,\(25\%\) loss,B,"First, we calculate the cost price (CP) of the oranges. The trader bought 100 oranges at a rate of 5 for N1.20, so the number of groups is \(\frac{100}{5}=20\). Thus, \(\text{CP}=20 \times 1.20=N24\). Next, since 20 oranges spoiled, 80 oranges were sold at 4 for N1.50, so the number of groups is \(\frac{80}{4}=20\) and the selling price (SP) is \(\text{SP}=20 \times 1.50=N30\). The profit is \(\text{Profit}=30-24=N6\). Finally, the percentage gain is calculated as \(\frac{6}{24}\times 100\% =25\%\). Therefore, the correct answer is option B.",Jamb 1999

The identity element is the number that, when used in the operation with any number, gives back that number. In this case, 0 is the identity. To find the inverse of 2 (call it \(x\)), we need \(2*x = 0\). That means \(2x + 2 + x = 3x + 2 = 0\). Solving for \(x\), we subtract 2 from both sides and then divide by 3: \(x = -\frac{2}{3}\).",Jamb 1999

Rationalize the denominator by multiplying numerator and denominator by \(\sqrt{2}+1\): \(x=\frac{(2+\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2}+1)}{(\sqrt{2})^2-1^2}=\frac{(2+\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2}+1)}{2-1}=(2+\sqrt{2})(\sqrt{2}+1)\).

The numerator becomes \(a^{\frac{3}{2}}b^{-\frac{9}{4}}c^{\frac{3}{4}}\). When dividing by \(a^{-1}b^{4}c^{5}\), subtract the exponents: For \(a\): \(\frac{3}{2}-(-1)=\frac{5}{2}\); for \(b\): \(-\frac{9}{4}-4=-\frac{25}{4}\); for \(c\): \(\frac{3}{4}-5=-\frac{17}{4}\).
