Here’s the complete text for your README.md file, ready for you to copy and paste. I’ve tailored it with placeholders for your GitHub username and repository name, which you’ll need to replace with your actual values (e.g., manirkhalil/maths-exam-prep). This matches the version we refined earlier, including the MIT License link.
